Problem
==========
Since the OperationID in OpenAPI spec are autogenerated during build time, 
the generated OperationID is bigger due to the presence of too many hierarchies in the yang model. 
we need a mechanism to override the autogenerated OperationID by taking manual input on specific cases.

Solution
===========
Replace models/yang/Makefile with the one in tarball
Replace tools/pyang/pyang_plugins/openapi.py with the one in tarball
Replace models/yang/common/sonic-extensions.yang with the one in tarball

Example model (how to use)
------------------------------
Refer acme-system.yang (if u want to try copy this to models/yang/)
Refer deviation model acme-system-annot.yang (if u want to try copy this to models/yang/annotations/)

Solution description
=======================
Introduced a new extension in models/yang/common/sonic-extensions.yang as shown below

extension openapi-opid {
    argument "openapi-opid";
    description "Custom Operation ID for OpenAPI";
}

which can be used by creating a deviation yang model for the yang model where the file name big error comes as shown below

Sample yang
==============
Refer acme-system.yang in the tarball

Sample deviation yang
=======================
module acme-system-annot {
  
    yang-version "1";

    namespace "http://openconfig.net/yang/acme-annotation";
    prefix "acme-annot";

    import sonic-extensions { prefix sonic-ext; }
    import acme-system { prefix acme; }

    deviation /acme:acme-system/acme:login/acme:user {
      deviate add {
        sonic-ext:openapi-opid "superUser";
      }
    }
}

The above extension will cause "superUser" to be used as OpId for node with
xpath /acme:acme-system/acme:login/acme:user. For all its children 
"superUser"+"child_name" will be used as OpId. If you want to suppress 
autogeneration of OpId for children provide deviations for childrens as well.
At any given time if there is any name collision error will be thrown.
